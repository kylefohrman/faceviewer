# faceviewer
Textured 3D face model with keyboard navigation, created with OpenGL in spring of 2021

Added key interactions for easier navigation:

	-SHIFT + up/down to adjust head position
	
	-g to show/hide grid
	
	-left/right to move along lines of latitude
	
	-up/down to move along lines of longitude
	
	-f to show/hide wireframe of quad mesh
	
	-SHIFT + f to show/hide textured mesh
	
	-p to show/hide subdivided mesh with texture
	
	-u to show/hide face texture

Please note that the objloader and vboindexer
must be placed in the common file before running.
