# faceviewer
Textured 3D face model with keyboard navigation, created with OpenGL

Added key interactions for easier navigation:
	-SHIFT + up/down to adjust head position
	-g to show/hide grid
  -left/right to move along lines of latitude
  -up/down to move along lines of longitude
  
  -f to show/hide wireframe of quad mesh
  -SHIFT + f to show/hide textured mesh
  -p to show/hide subdivided mesh with texture
  -u to show/hide face texture

Please note that the objloader and vboindexer
must be moved placed in the common file before running
